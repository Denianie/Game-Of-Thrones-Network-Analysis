# Game of Thrones Network Analysis

This repository contains a network analysis of characters from the 'Game of Thrones' series using Python, Pandas, and NetworkX. The project explores the relationships between characters across different books in the series to reveal insights about their social dynamics.

## Objective

To identify and analyze the relationships among 'Game of Thrones' characters to understand the underlying social dynamics.

## Key Findings

- **Most central characters**: In the first book, Eddard Stark emerged as the most central figure. However, in the fifth book, Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen took the lead.
- **Strongest connections**: Houses Stark and Lannister showed the strongest inter-character connections, reflecting their significant influence throughout the series.

## Project Learnings

1. **Data manipulation and analysis**: Mastered the use of Pandas for cleaning, filtering, and analyzing complex datasets.
2. **Visualization techniques**: Developed advanced skills in Matplotlib for creating compelling visual representations of network data.
3. **Network analysis**: Gained proficiency in NetworkX to construct and interpret complex network graphs.
4. **Pattern recognition**: Enhanced ability to identify and analyze patterns in data, providing deeper insights into character interactions and their narrative significance.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of character co-occurrence information from the 'Game of Thrones' books. It describes the interactions between characters, with attributes attached to each edge describing the type and weight of their interactions.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using pip:
